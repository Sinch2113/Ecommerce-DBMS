# Ecommerce-DBMS
In this modern era of online shopping no seller wants to be left behind, due to its simplicity the shift from offline selling model to an online selling model ,Ecommerce is witnessing a rampant growth. Therefore, as an engineer our job is to ease the path of this transition for the seller. Amongst many things that an online site requires the most important is a database system. 
Hence in this project we have designed a database where a online store can sell their products online.
 A customer who shops for the first time on the site is required to enter basic details that are used to identify the customer and during processing of their order.
 Products available on the site are categorized based on domains ex: Electronics, Apparel,Books etc. The product Name ,price, sizes,colors are displayed on site. The customer can check and can only order less than or equal to the stock available for the product.User can find every product we own in a category.
 The E-Commerce site contacts the supplier to supply the products as per the customers’ product specifications.
 Every customer is provided with a cart which is assigned with a cart ID.
 An Cart may consist of one or more products from different categories. These products added into cart constitute the Cart items.These items in cart can be purchased or unpurchased and database application user will only be able to view the products in cart and set them to purchased or unpurchased.
 The payment details of every transaction/Order is stored in database. Payment id is given by the bank along with payment mode.Total Amount is automatically calculated by using a formula Ʃ(Product price*Quantity ordered) .
